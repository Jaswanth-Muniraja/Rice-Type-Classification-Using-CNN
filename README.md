# Rice-Type-Classification-Using-CNN
This project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies different types of rice grains using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and deployed using Flask, it provides a simple interface for users to upload rice grain images and receive instant predictions.

## 🧪 Model Training
The CNN model was trained on a dataset of rice grain images, preprocessed using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation. The architecture includes:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction

MaxPooling layers for downsampling

Dense layers for classification

Softmax activation for multi-class output
